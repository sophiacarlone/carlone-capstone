I had more issues with Hydra and my VM. All I wanted to do was ssh into my VM for my class. This led me down learning about syslogs and also UFW being in existance. UFW being the problem because it could clearly connect to the internet to get packages, but I did not know there was another firewall on ubuntu live servers themselves.

I was also doing some organization of the server room.
