I should reset all the passwords

Sadly, time got the better of me and I forgot somethings. What needs to happen is there needs to be a bridge in the vm host for the vms to connect so you can ssh in. You can look at hydra if you need an example.

You should also be able to ssh into the vm if you are already at the host
create a vlan page on book

hydra wasnt down before. I probably was the one who broke it a couple of weeks ago

Couldn't get m3 out for the life of me
Tried for over an hour and with two guys for help
Had to cut my loses and just have m4 unscrewed so I can make progress

I put in the switch
I plugged in the switch
I labelled private and plugged that in so it is going thru the private switch
I put in red dwarf as well
I can now ping red dwarf

Didn't work!

Scar — 04/13/2023 6:09 PM
tried to just undo the bridge I made a while ago and it still not working
its not the cable
took out all comments, but that shouldnt work
its so fucking slow
it has a destination host unreachable

Hydra has no route to jesabelle but one to google. It can download updates
need to check if it is getting it from mirror, I suspect not tho because it could not reach mirror before
I keep getting a connection time out

Scar — 04/13/2023 9:42 PM
ssh hydra        
ssh: connect to host 128.153.145.42 port 13699: Connection timed out
before, I went into the nftables for our firewall and saw that there was a hold poked, but for port 13699 on hydra, while hydra was still on the default of port 22

going to man ssh on hydra shows where the config files are and that is where you can see in the sshd.config what port is is set at

I upgraded hydra, it restarted some services
I got traceroute on hydra and it seemed to be able to connect to everything in one hop
I was able to ssh into ziltoid from hydra
lets see, next steps is to try and get to hydra again. if not, this might be a firewall problem afterall

Scar — 04/17/2023 6:37 PM
tail -f /var/log/syslog
so I looked at hydra again to see why I cant ssh
i was with another lab director: Peter

Scar — 04/17/2023 6:45 PM
he told me about syslog, and apparently tail has a option called -f that means to constantly refresh
we saw there was something called UFW BLOCK that was blocking that port.
UFW means uncontrolled firewall, and every ubuntu server has it and you need to add a hole for ssh into that fire wall. Now I can get in

I learned from yesterday and when my vm could not be pinged or ping anything I looked at UFW. There I saw it was disabled

today I went to clean up the server room and do some cable management before an important guest arrives
there should be no tripping hazards in the room
mounted m4 in the correct place
we had to unplug ziltoid and talos for a bit to make things cleaner. This left DNS messy
I had to have others help while I made a phone call and got food
but when I got back, it was still partly down. I got on talos and it was just because nsd was down
