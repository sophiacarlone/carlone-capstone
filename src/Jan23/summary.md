# January 2023

The start of the capstone. Some things that happened before the logs was figuring out everything was broken. That was fun. Some people, including myself, went up to Clarkson before the Spring semester started to get things less broken. This is talked about more in my actual capstone thesis. We got DNS working, DHCP working, ziltoid OS and Talos OS reinstalled.

I was working on getting the virtual machines (vms) on Hydra running after reinstalling the operating system with two lab members, one of which has never done so before. I had to backup all the vms to Mirror, then put them all back and turn on the ones that were needed (aka should be active). Had some problems in which I had to challenge my assumptions here.  

There was some random work here and there, and I was starting to figure out possible problems in the network and what I should do with my capstone.
