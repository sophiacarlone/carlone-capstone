More ideas for the capstone, like the Discord bot that I ended up doing. 

There was also some issues with the firewall that other COSI members took care of.  Other issues include ssh problems and the start of issues with purchases. Cool thing though, I met someone who was head of the SCaN division at NASA previously and I showed them around COSI. 

There were also issues with making a VM for my SC350 (Software D&D) class, but it was a cool learning experience, especially with making that bridge on my own VM.
