Kept working on Hydra and go that all set up.

A researcher under Jeanna was having a hard time connecting to Red Dwarf and Prometheus (research servers). We tried connecting them to different switches and to our own machines. Learned a bit about cable testing and general network debugging issues with a network.   

COSI started communication with OIT about what was happening with the network and specifically our access to the Internet.
