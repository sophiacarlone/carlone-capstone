# October 2023

This was the month I created the first version of the new topology and got feedback and approval from the lab (or at least those who came to the aftermeeting slot). I talk more about what my goals where in the topology in my formal capstone. There are also plans to address one member's concerns by implementing a KVM over IP. 

We have had some big developments this month. My fellow lab director was trying to get a connection to COLO, which broke our network for a weekend. We had to wait for OITâ€™s help since it was a connection to one of their switches. OIT said the problem was with the transceiver used. 

Even after that was fixed, we still could not get a connection to COLO. It is most likely that it is our fiber optic cables that are broken. More will need to be bought. When purchasing these items, I learned that there are different types of fiber optic cables. There is a multi-mode or single-mode type that determines the width of the passage the light can travel through the connector. There is also LC UPC and SC UPC. UPC means there is Ultra-Physical Contact and LC vs SC is another size determination. For COSI, we needed LC UPC to SC UPC, duplex singlemode cables.
