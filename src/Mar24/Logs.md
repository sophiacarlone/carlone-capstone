got ziltoid OS reinstalled. Teached someone how to do that, but I will probably reinstall it with live server since I thought teaching them how to use desktop would be less scary and more likely for them to use<br>
Myself, Juno, and Amity did some book documentation

I walked ziltoid down to COLO. Luckily one COSI alum I knew was walking around as well so it was nice to have a second pair of hands. Ziltoid was updated with Ubuntu Live Server for the ping bot. We got it mounted and I forgot to get a transceiver and I brought the wrong power cable

I went down again before the spring break with Juno. We just wanted to plut ziltoid in so that I can work on it over the break, but it turns out the transciever we had is broken, so it will have to be connected when we get back to clarkson<br>
Oh! I also wanted to get the units so that I can write it on book.
