# February 2024

I kept working on my "ping bot", but it had issues, mostly stemming from the fact that my connection down at my woodstock (at the very bottom of the hill) is bad, even when wired. I also spent time on improving it a bit. 

The COSI server room got a new rack and universal rails donated by OIT. Which is great for THE GREAT COSI MOVE OF 2024.

Working with OIT, I and one lab director (I gave it up for my last semester here) went down to COLO where we tested the uplink to the Hill campus. At first there was a problem with the transceiver with OITâ€™s end, but an uplink has now been installed and the COSI move can proceed. 

THE GREAT COSI MOVE OF 2024 was put into full swing with seven people there to help out. We divided into two teams to move things around. One on the hill and one in COLO. After movement in COLO, there were some issues with connectivity, but they turned out to be minor. TalDOS did not boot correct (cause it is so old) and some cables were in the wrong ports. That is not too bad. 

The movement of servers in the server room was done on the break weekend Clarkson had. With all that done, THE GREAT COSI MOVE OF 2024 was complete!
