Last friday I made a bot that simply pings each server and alerts when something cannot be pinged

I forgot to say this: On January 19th, Cary, Juno, and I took a quick trip to COLO to clean everything out

The problem right now is that we are waiting for universal rails for COLO, which also means that we are waiting to know who to send purchase orders too since the original person moved jobs and the next person quit. Maciel is looking into that for us

Some ideas for the ping bot are to have it slow down over night so that it does not spam everyone when they wake up in the morning (even though it doesnt ping anyone)
