# January 2024

Getting right back into the school year, it has been a long time since someone regenerated the passwords for our devices. One of the new switches has a password of “password” for convenience and was never switched to something else. It would be better to change most of those that have been used for many years. Also, the lockbox that the lab directors are able to unlock that hosts these root passwords is very outdated and messy. I created a new password template with an emphasis on marking the date it was made, so that there would be no mistake on which information is the most modern.

I created a plan on how a server moving day (now being named THE GREAT COSI MOVE OF 2024) could be organized. It involves two teams, with one at COLO and one at COSI. Presented it to interested members after a lab meeting. We also prepared for THE GREAT COSI MOVE OF 2024 by cleaning out COLO entirely.
 
I learned how to create a Discord bot for pinging our services to find if anything went down. It was having many problems with spamming the lab members overnight, but it was able to detect Hydra being unreachable. More improvements can be made. At least I have something for the management that will be useful for lab members.
