Monday before break 11/20 we finally got our fiber cables in the mail.<br>
So, we had OIT look at everything for the switch. They switched out the transeiver and so that was good, so we deduced it was a fiber cable issue<br>
We got the cables, put one in cosi and the other in colo and we passed the blinky light test.<br>
Cary even connected directly to bacon and was able to ping google<br>
yay!
