Monday before break 11/20 we finally got our fiber cables in the mail.
So, we had OIT look at everything for the switch. They switched out the transiever and so that was good, so we deduced it was a fiber cable issue
We got the cables, put one in cosi and the other in colo and we passed the blinky light test.
Cary even connected to bacon and was able to ping google
yay!
